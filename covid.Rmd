## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}

#change path
base_folder <- "D:/Trent University/R ONLINE LECTURERS/Assignments/Covid_data_analysis/"
inputfolder <- paste0(base_folder,"inputfiles/")

coronavirus <- read.csv(paste0(inputfolder,"coronavirus_dataset.csv"))
coronavirus  <- coronavirus %>% rename(dateVals=date)
coronavirus$dateVals = as.Date(coronavirus$dateVals)

```



The hypothesis for the Chi-square Test of Independence regarding the association between country/region and the type of COVID-19 cases (e.g., confirmed, recovered, deceased) can be stated as follows:

Null Hypothesis (H0): There is no significant difference in the mean number of confirmed cases across different time points within each country/region. Mathematically, this can be expressed as 

Alternative Hypothesis (H1): There is a significant difference in the mean number of confirmed cases across different time points within each country/region


In simpler terms, the null hypothesis suggests that the proportions of confirmed, recovered, and deceased cases are the same across all countries/regions, while the alternative hypothesis suggests that the proportions vary among countries/regions. The Chi-square test will help determine if there is enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative, indicating that there is indeed an association between country/region and the type of COVID-19 cases.


Before conducting hypothesis we do
